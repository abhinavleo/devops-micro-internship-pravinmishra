# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

I understood that Haiku is a good choice for cost optimzer because it can analyse and suggest cost saving imrovements.This task doesnt need any complex thinking so using more faster affordable model makes sense

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

Its job is only to check and review the Terraform files,not change them.Keeping the permissions limited makes it safer and reduse risk of accidently modifying the important files.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

I've learned that tf-writer uses inherit so it can use default model cofigured in Claude code instead of fixed one.It gives more flexibility while generating and editing Terraformcode

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

#### Screenshot 5 — Security audit report output

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
